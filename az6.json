Offer 6–10 case prompts derived from the selected 'case' nodes (or propose plausible variants if none selected).\n   - Include choices like: city/region, time window, environmental indicators, health outcome, and whether linkage is aggregate or individual-level in a TRE.\n2) Write a realistic narrative of the chosen case, including stakeholders (e.g., local authority, NHS/TRE, DEFRA/Met Office, academics, community).\n3) Explain the technical pipeline (formats/resolutions, ETL, overlays, UPRN extraction) and the governance pipeline (FAIR/licensing, GDPR/DPIA, TRE boundaries).\n4) Identify 5–8 risks/pathologies (resolution misuse, cost runaway, AI hallucination, skills gaps) and mitigation controls (standards, observability, guardrails).\n5) Deliver an implementation playbook:\n   - Data acquisition & harmonisation steps\n   - Service/API design (including UPRN extraction)\n   - TRE workflow for sensitive analysis\n   - Metadata + RAG approach for user navigation\n   - Measurement plan (usage, cost, data quality, user satisfaction)\n6) End with 2 safe-to-fail experiments and clear success/backfire signals.\n"
